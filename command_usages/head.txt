Applications of head Command

 

Print line between M and N lines(M>N): For this purpose, we use the head, tail, and pipeline(|) commands. The command is: head -M file_name | tail +N since the head command takes first M lines and from M lines tail command cuts lines starting from +N till the end, we can also use head -M file_name | tail +(M-N+1) command since the head command takes first M lines and from M lines tail command cuts (M-N+1) lines starting from the end. Let say from the state.txt file we have to print lines between 10 and 20. 
 
$ head -n 20 state.txt | tail -10
Jharkhand
Karnataka
Kerala
Madhya Pradesh
Maharashtra
Manipur
Meghalaya
Mizoram
Nagaland
Odisha
How to use the head with pipeline(|): The head command can be piped with other commands. In the following example, the output of the ls command is piped to head to show only the three most recently modified files or folders. 
 
Display all recently modified or recently used files.
$ ls -t
e.txt 
d.txt
c.txt
b.txt  
a.txt

Cut three most recently used file.
$ ls -t | head -n 3
e.txt
d.txt
c.txt
It can also be piped with one or more filters for additional processing. For example, the sort filter could be used to sort the three most recently used files or folders in the alphabetic order. 
 
$ ls -t | head -n 3 | sort
c.txt
d.txt
e.txt
There are number of other filters or commands along which we use head command. Mainly, it can be used for viewing huge log files in Unix.

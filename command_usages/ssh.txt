Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data
communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and
other secure network services between two networked computers that connects,
via a secure channel over an insecure network, a server and a client (running SSH
server and SSH client programs, respectively).







SSH Client Version:
Sometimes it may be necessary to identify the SSH client that you are currently running and it’s corresponding
version number, which can be identified as shown below. Please note that Linux comes with OpenSSH.
$ ssh -V
OpenSSH_3.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.7a Feb 19 2003
$ ssh -V
ssh: SSH Secure Shell 3.2.9.1 (non-commercial version) on i686-pc-linux-gnu

Login to remote host:
The First time when you login to the remotehost from a localhost, it will display the host key not found
message and you can give “yes” to continue. The host key of the remote host will be added under
.ssh2/hostkeys directory of your home directory, as shown below.
localhost$ ssh -l jsmith remotehost.example.com

File transfer to/from remote host:
Another common use of ssh client is to copy files from/to remote host using scp.
Copy file from the remotehost to the localhost:
 localhost$scp jsmith@remotehost.example.com:/home/jsmith/remotehostfile.txt remotehostfile.txt
Copy file from the localhost to the remotehost:
 localhost$scp localhostfile.txt jsmith@remotehost.example.com:/home/jsmith/localhostfile.txt

 Debug SSH Client:
Sometimes it is necessary to view debug messages to troubleshoot any SSH connection issues. For this purpose,
pass -v (lowercase v) option to the ssh as shown below.
Example without debug message:
 localhost$ ssh -l jsmith remotehost.example.com
 warning: Connecting to remotehost.example.com failed: No address associated to the name
 localhost$
Example with debug message:
 locaclhost$ ssh -v -l jsmith remotehost.example.com
 debug: SshConfig/sshconfig.c:2838/ssh2_parse_config_ext: Metaconfig parsing stopped at line 3.
 debug: SshConfig/sshconfig.c:637/ssh_config_set_param_verbose: Setting variable 'VerboseMode' to 'FALSE'.
 debug: SshConfig/sshconfig.c:3130/ssh_config_read_file_ext: Read 17 params from config file.
 debug: Ssh2/ssh2.c:1707/main: User config file not found, using defaults. (Looked for '/home/jsmith/.ssh2/ssh2_config')
 debug: Connecting to remotehost.example.com, port 22... (SOCKS not used)
 warning: Connecting to remotehost.example.com failed: No address associated to the name

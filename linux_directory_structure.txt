In Linux/Unix operating system everything is a file even directories are files, files are files, and devices like mouse, keyboard, printer, etc are also files.



Types of files in the Linux system. 
 General Files – It is also called ordinary files. It may be an image, video, program, or simple text files. These types of files can be in ASCII or Binary format. It is the most commonly used file in the Linux system.
Directory Files – These types of files are a warehouse for other file types. It may be a directory file within a directory (subdirectory).
Device Files – In a Windows-like operating system, devices like CD-ROM, and hard drives are represented as drive letters like F: G: H whereas in the Linux system device are represented as files. As for example, /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 and so on.

in the Linux/Unix operating system files are stored in a tree-like structure starting with the root directory

The base of the Linux/Unix file system hierarchy begins at the root and everything starts with the root directory. 

These are the common top-level directories associated with the root directory:
/toot: Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy. 
	Every single file and directory starts from the root directory
	The only root user has the right to write under this directory
	/root is the root user’s home directory, which is not the same as /
/bin – binary or executable programs.
	Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp. 
	Contains binary executables
	Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
	Commands used by all the users of the system are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp
/etc – Host-specific system-wide system configuration files.
	Contains configuration files required by all programs.
	This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
	Example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf.

/home – Users’ home directories. It is the default current directory. 
	Home directories for all users to store their saved and personal files.
	example: /home/kishlay, /home/kv

/opt – optional or third-party software. Optional application software packages.
	Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
	Add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.

/tmp – temporary space, typically cleared on reboot. Temporary files. Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted.
	Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
	Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

/usr – User related programs. Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications. 
	Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
	/usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If you can’t find a user binary under /bin, look under /usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
	/usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators. If you can’t find a system binary under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
	/usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
	/usr/local contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2
	/usr/src holds the Linux kernel sources, header-files and documentation.


/var – log files.

/boot- It contains all the boot-related information files and folders such as conf, grub, etc.
	/boot : Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd. 
	Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
	Example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic

/dev – It is the location of the Essential device filessuch as dev/sda1, dev/sda2, /dev/null etc. 
	These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
/lib – It contains kernel modules and shared libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.
	Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
	Example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7

/lost+found – It is used to find recovered bits of corrupted files.
/media – It contains subdirectories where removal media devices inserted. Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3).
	Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
	Examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer

/mnt – It contains temporary mount directories for mounting the file system. Temporarily mounted filesystems.
	Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.

/proc – It is a virtual and pseudo-file system to contains info about the running processes with a specific process ID or PID. Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.
	Contains information about system process.
	This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.
	This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime

/run – It stores volatile runtime data.
/sbin – binary executable programs for an administrator. Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.
	Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
	The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrator, for system maintenance purpose.
	Example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon

/srv – It contains server-specific and server-related files. Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems.
	srv stands for service.
	Contains server specific services related data.
	Example, /srv/cvs contains CVS related data.

/sys – It is a virtual filesystem for modern Linux distributions to store and allows modification of the devices connected to the system.


In Linux, some well-defined configuration files, binaries, man pages information files available for every process. these files can be accessed/changed using root previledges only, User needs to be logged in using root user.

The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation. 

In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.
Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.
Most of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.
